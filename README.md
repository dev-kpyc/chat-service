## Chat-Service

This is a sample project that I developed to become familiar with Go. 

The architecture is inspired by [The Clean Architecture](https://www.google.com) by Uncle Bob, and I borrowed heavily from [Domain Hex](https://github.com/katzien/go-structure-examples/tree/master/domain-hex) layout in the design of this go-based microservice.

This project also makes use of [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) for local development against Minikube.
